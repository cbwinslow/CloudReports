# Security Guide

## Overview

Security is a critical aspect of the Enterprise Reporting System, especially when collecting and transmitting sensitive system information. This document outlines security best practices and configurations.

## Credential Management

### SSH Keys for Remote Collection

The system requires SSH key authentication for remote server collection. Follow these steps to set up secure access:

1. Generate a dedicated SSH key pair for monitoring:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "reports@yourdomain.com" -f ~/.ssh/reports_key
   ```

2. Set proper permissions on the private key:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/reports_key
   ```

3. Distribute the public key to target servers:
   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/reports_key.pub user@target-server
   ```

4. Configure the system to use the dedicated key in `config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "remote_servers": {
       "servers": [
         {
           "name": "server1",
           "ssh_key": "/home/user/.ssh/reports_key"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

### Credential Storage

Store credentials securely using the system's credential management:

1. Create a dedicated, secure credential file:
   ```bash
   touch ~/reports/secure_credentials.json
   chmod 600 ~/reports/secure_credentials.json
   ```

2. Store only encrypted or hashed values where possible

3. Use environment variables or external secrets management for sensitive data

## Data Encryption

### At-Rest Encryption

Enable data encryption for stored reports:

```bash
# Example encryption command for sensitive datasets
tar -czf report.tar.gz report_data/ && 
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in report.tar.gz -out report.tar.gz.enc -pass pass:yourpassword
```

### In-Transit Encryption

SSH provides encryption for remote data collection by default. Verify SSH configuration:

```bash
# Check SSH version and ciphers
ssh -Q cipher
```

## Network Security

### Firewall Configuration

Configure firewall rules to limit access to the reporting system:

```bash
# Example iptables rules
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -s trusted_subnet -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP
```

### Secure Communication Ports

If using API endpoints, ensure they use secure protocols:

- Use HTTPS instead of HTTP
- Implement certificate validation
- Consider using VPN or private networks for sensitive communications

## Access Control

### User Permissions

Run the reporting system with a dedicated, limited-privilege user account:

```bash
# Create a dedicated user
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/bash -d /home/reports reports

# Set appropriate permissions
sudo chown -R reports:reports ~/reports/
```

### File Permissions

The system implements the following permission structure:

- Scripts: 750 (owner: read/write/execute, group: read/execute)
- Configuration files: 640 (owner: read/write, group: read)
- Data directories: 750
- Credential files: 600 (owner: read/write)

## Audit and Logging

Enable comprehensive logging to detect security events:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "audit_logging": true,
    "log_file": "/var/log/reports_audit.log",
    "retention_days": 90
  }
}
```

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy

Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations:

- Minimize collection of personally identifiable information (PII)
- Implement data retention policies
- Securely dispose of old reports

### Industry Standards

Align with relevant security frameworks:

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001
- SOX (if applicable)
- GDPR (if applicable)
- HIPAA (if applicable)

## Security Monitoring

### Intrusion Detection

Monitor access to the reporting system:

- Log all report executions
- Monitor file access to configuration and data directories
- Implement file integrity monitoring for critical components

### Vulnerability Management

Keep the system updated:

- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor security advisories for used tools
- Implement a patching process for the reporting system

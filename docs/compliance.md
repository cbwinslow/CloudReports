# Compliance and Governance

## Overview

This document outlines the Enterprise Reporting System's approach to compliance with various regulatory frameworks and standards. The system is designed to support compliance requirements across different industries including finance, healthcare, and government.

## Compliance Frameworks

### SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)

The system supports SOX compliance requirements by providing:

- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all system access and configuration changes
- **Segregation of Duties**: Role-based access controls to prevent conflicts of interest
- **Data Integrity**: Immutable logging of all report collection activities
- **Change Control**: Documentation of all system modifications

#### SOX Implementation

```json
{
  "compliance": {
    "sox": {
      "enabled": true,
      "audit_logging": {
        "enabled": true,
        "retention_days": 730,
        "immutable": true
      },
      "access_controls": {
        "rbac_enabled": true,
        "segregation_of_duties": true
      },
      "change_management": {
        "config_change_logging": true,
        "approval_workflow": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

For environments that may handle cardholder data:

- **Secure Data Transmission**: SSH for remote collection, encrypted storage
- **Network Security**: Secure communication protocols
- **Access Controls**: Authentication and authorization
- **Monitoring**: Intrusion detection capabilities

### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)

For healthcare environments:

- **Data Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with audit trails
- **Data Minimization**: Collection only of necessary information
- **Audit Controls**: Comprehensive logging of all system access

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

For EU operations:

- **Data Minimization**: Collection only of necessary information
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **Right to Erasure**: APIs to delete specific data
- **Data Portability**: Export capabilities for user data

### ISO 27001

The system supports implementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS):

- **Asset Management**: Inventory and classification of information assets
- **Access Control**: User access management controls
- **Cryptography**: Data encryption capabilities
- **Logging and Monitoring**: System monitoring and event logging

## Data Governance

### Data Classification

The system supports data classification to ensure appropriate handling:

- **Public**: Information that can be disclosed publicly
- **Internal**: Information intended for internal use
- **Confidential**: Sensitive information requiring protection
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive information with strict access controls

### Data Retention Policies

Configure data retention based on compliance requirements:

```json
{
  "data_retention": {
    "general_reports": {
      "retention_days": 365,
      "auto_archive_after": 90,
      "auto_delete_after": 365
    },
    "audit_logs": {
      "retention_days": 730,
      "auto_delete_after": 730,
      "encrypt_during_retention": true
    },
    "sensitive_data": {
      "retention_days": 30,
      "auto_delete_after": 30,
      "additional_encryption": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Minimization

The system is designed to collect only necessary information:

- **Configurable Collection**: Enable/disable specific data points
- **Field-level Controls**: Control which fields are collected
- **Masking**: Optional masking of sensitive information

## Security Controls

### Access Management

- **Authentication**: Multiple authentication methods (API keys, tokens, basic auth)
- **Authorization**: Role-based access controls
- **Account Management**: User lifecycle management

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption
- **Backup**: Secure backup and recovery procedures
- **Disposal**: Secure data deletion procedures

### Monitoring and Logging

- **System Logs**: Comprehensive logging of all system activities
- **Access Logs**: Detailed logs of all user access
- **Security Events**: Special handling of security-related events
- **Audit Reports**: Regular generation of audit reports

## Compliance Reporting

### Automated Compliance Reports

The system can generate compliance-focused reports:

- **Access Summary**: Who accessed what, when
- **Configuration Changes**: What changed, when, and by whom
- **Security Events**: Summary of security-related incidents
- **Data Retention**: Summary of data lifecycle management

### Report Templates

Standardized templates for different compliance frameworks:

```json
{
  "compliance_reports": {
    "sox": {
      "template": "sox_template.json",
      "schedule": "monthly",
      "recipients": ["compliance@company.com"]
    },
    "hipaa": {
      "template": "hipaa_template.json",
      "schedule": "quarterly",
      "recipients": ["hipaa.officer@company.com"]
    }
  }
}
```

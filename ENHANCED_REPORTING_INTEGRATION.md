```

### API Endpoints
All new capabilities are exposed through RESTful API endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/cybersecurity/process_monitoring` - Process monitoring data
- `GET /api/v1/cybersecurity/storage_monitoring` - Storage monitoring data  
- `GET /api/v1/cybersecurity/grafana_integration` - Grafana integration status
- `GET /api/v1/cybersecurity/opensearch_integration` - OpenSearch integration status

### Command Line Interface
The extended runner script now supports all new modules:

```bash
# Run specific reports
python3 run_reports_extended.py run-single --type process_monitoring
python3 run_reports_extended.py run-single --type storage_monitoring
python3 run_reports_extended.py run-single --type grafana_integration
python3 run_reports_extended.py run-single --type opensearch_integration

# List all available report types
python3 run_reports_extended.py list-types

# Run all enhanced reports
python3 run_reports_extended.py run-all
```

### Shell Scripts
Additional shell scripts for batch processing:

- `run_all_enhanced_reports.sh` - Runs all enhanced reports in parallel

## Integration Features

### Grafana Integration
The system provides seamless integration with Grafana for advanced visualization:
1. **Automatic Dashboard Creation**: Pre-built dashboards for system metrics
2. **Data Synchronization**: Real-time synchronization with Grafana data sources
3. **Alerting**: Integration with Grafana's alerting system through annotations
4. **Organization Management**: Multi-tenant support for organizations

### OpenSearch Integration
The system integrates with OpenSearch for powerful log aggregation and search:
1. **Index Management**: Automatic creation and management of indices
2. **Document Indexing**: Efficient indexing of report data
3. **Search Capabilities**: Advanced search and filtering across all reports
4. **Cluster Monitoring**: Health and performance monitoring of OpenSearch clusters
